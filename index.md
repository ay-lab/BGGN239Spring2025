title: Bioinformatics for Immunologists <br> (BGGN 239, Spring 2025)
---

## Overview
Bioinformatics is conceptualizing biology in terms of macromolecules and then applying "informatics" techniques derived from disciplines such as applied mathematics, computer science, and statistics to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large-scale.

Among many other discoveries, bioinformatics approaches coupled with sequencing of RNA and DNA molecules have enabled the discovery of new immune cell types and previously uncharacterized functions for known immune cells in the context of different diseases.

This course has an integrated lecture/exercise structure with a strong lineup of faculty and instructors who are renowned experts in their respective fields, who are committed to teach bioinformatics with a specific focus on its applications to important problems in immunology through practical and hands-on training likely to impact students' overall success in their research

Major topics include:

- Gene expression analysis; 
- Human genetics; 
- Epigenomics in immune cells; 
- Epitopes; 
- Neoantigens; 
- Proteomics; 
- Metabolomics; and 
- Imaging analysis.  

 Students completing this course will be able to:

- Understand main computational concepts underlying commonly used bioinformatics tools; 
- Be familiar with online databases and resources (e.g., GWAS catalog, IEDB, DICE, ImmGen, ENCODE, IHEC) and efficient ways to query them; 
- Be able to utilize existing tools to perform data analysis for several different sequencing and imaging techniques; and
- Learn and actively utilize best practices for reproducible research and collaboration related to bioinformatics (project organization, version control, online lab notebooks).
